# Advent of Code 2024 – Solutions Repository

This repository contains my personal solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 challenges. Each day presents a unique programming puzzle that tests algorithmic thinking, problem-solving skills, and coding efficiency.

---

## Structure

Each day's solution is organized in its own folder:
- `day01/` through `day25/`
- Each folder typically includes:
  - "day_x_1"
  - "day_x_2"

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Standard libraries: `re`, `collections`, `itertools`, `math`, etc.
- Occasional use of external tools for visualization or benchmarking

---

## Status

- ✅ Days 1–20, 22, 23, 25: Fully implemented and polished
- ⚠️ Days 21 and 24: Completed but not yet cleaned up  
  These solutions work, but I plan to revisit them to improve readability, structure, and performance before uploading.
